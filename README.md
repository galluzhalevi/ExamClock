# 🎓 Exam Clock

A clean, high-contrast digital clock designed specifically for exam halls and classrooms. This tool helps students keep track of time without the distraction of ticking seconds or small digits.

## ✨ Features
- **Rounded Time Display:** Updates only at specific intervals (1, 2, 5, 10, 12, or 15 minutes) to help students focus on milestones rather than passing seconds.
- **Landscape View:** Optimized for projectors with exam details on one side and a massive clock on the other.
- **Bilingual Support:** Full RTL (Right-to-Left) support for Hebrew and LTR for English.
- **Minimalist Design:** No database, no tracking, just a simple single-session tool.
- **Smart Setup:** Configure Start, End, and Extra Time using a clean Material-themed time picker.

## 🤖 Built with AI
This project was designed and coded through a collaborative session with **T3 Chat**, powered by the **Gemini 3 Flash** model. The AI assisted in:
- Architecting the dual-language RTL/LTR layout.
- Implementing the custom time-rounding logic.
- Refining the high-visibility classroom UI.
